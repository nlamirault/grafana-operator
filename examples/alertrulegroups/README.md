Shows how to create an alert rule group, contained in a folder.

The easiest way to build alerts is using the Grafana UI.
After creating the rule, use the [Modify Export](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/set-up/provision-alerting-resources/export-alerting-resources/#modify-and-export-alert-rules-without-saving-changes) feature to get the correct YAML from your resource.
